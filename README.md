# MLP with backpropagation to predict YouTube video views
MSc final project

The project outlines the relationship between YouTube videos metadata and their views as well as attempting the prediction of their future values. The main assumption resides in the possibility of predicting views independently from channel success or content type and infer on how certain combinations of basic features influence and explain the view number. The aim is to reach a deep learning model that can potentially be used by new creators to predict a future performance solely based on initial metadata.
